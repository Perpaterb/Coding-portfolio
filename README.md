##Description of portfolio website.

#Purpose

I wanted to create a portfolio for the purpose of showing off my work.

I wanted to create a site that didn’t look at all like a template website and was unusable.
I settled on a filing cabinet as the theme. I wanted a sense of looking into an old school files system to look at my hopefully new school work.

#Functionality / features

You start with opening the filing cabinet draw. The "about me" page only opened after the draw opens.
The aim is a bit of immersion. It’s a hard like between annoying time wasting and immersion. implementing a skip amination on 2nd click would be a good idea I think.

The navigation bar at the top looks like folders in a filing cabinet. And the actual navigation invisible buttons move as the page size changes. Including looking quite different in portrait. 

Buttons glow slightly when hoved.

Wide screen and half wide screen windows are supported. 

Images are high resolution from 4k and 3440x1440 monitors. Images are appropriate resolution for 1080p and smaller mobiles.

#Target audience
I am hoping to use this as a personal blog from me projects in the future.
So I guess the target audiences are a potential employer, anyone wanting to look at my projects and myself.
