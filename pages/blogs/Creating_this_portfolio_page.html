                        <p>I wanted to preview work and blog pages and have a blerb before sending to the link.<br>
                            <br>
                            I was trying to make a div hiden then un hiden with CSS but strugled a be. Then a JS solution popped up. I have not worked much with JS but it is a programing lang and turns out it makes a lot of sence to me.<br>
                            <br>
                            so 30 min later it was all working and looking the way I wanted it to.<br>
                            <br>
                            basicaly it closes all the work divs by setting (style.display = 'none') on everything with (.work_display_div) class. Then the ID sent to the JS by the HTML apllys a class (classList.add('activeworkbar')) and the connectced div (style.display = "block";)<br>
