                        <p><b>The problem</b></p><br>
                        The IT Support Centre at UTS has always had a problem with reporting<br>
                        <br>
                        Over the counter reporting is always the hardest.<br>
                        You can't always get a Student or staff ID number and people rushing around just interrupt while you are helping someone else to ask you a question.<br>
                        <br>
                        Phone calls are a bit easier but it is always hard as the contact center doesn't link up with the service desk systems and over 50% of phone calls will require 2 tickets to be logged.<br>
                        <br>
                        We knew we were getting in acurit numbers as the current systems took about 20 seconds to log each ticket and was quite annoying as you needed to wait for pages to load.  <br>
                        </p>

                        <p><b>What we needed</b></p><br>
                            <p>I took it upon myself to try to solve this problem as well as I could.<br>
                                <br>
                                I set some project goles<br>
                                1. Simplify the number of quick template options<br>
                                2. Manage quick template by focusing on what we really wanted to know.  <br>
                                3. Minimise the number of clicks and time needed to log a quick template ticket.<br>
                                <br>
                                I knew that if I made it easy it would be more accurate.<br>
                            </p>

                        <p><b>2014 - 2017</b> QT logger V1-3</p><br>
                        <p>As I have no access to the API of service desk systems. I was limited to in some way interacting with the service desk systems web page itself.<br>
                            <br>                                
                        QT loggers V1-3 were mostly the same.<br>
                        I created a UI with all the quick template tickets options and myself and my colleagues would click on a "+" symbol to add a count.<br>
                        At the end of the day the program would run and create all the tickets very quickly by basically clicking on the screen.<br>
                         This was not ideal for many reasons. mostly because we were getting no time of the day data but also because if there was a slight change in the way the service desk systems looked or worked it would fail. <br>
                         <br>
                        I say there were 3 versions at this point but they were mostly because there was a major update to the service desk systems and I needed to change the way the QT logger ran.<br>
                        <br>
                        It worked and people were mostly happy.

                        <p>Yay for Java script!!<br>
                          <br>
                          Turns out you can run JS from a bookmark.<br>
                          <br>
                          Life save now all we needed was 2 clicks and to have an open ServiceNow page and 3 seconds later the ticket was logged.<br>
                        </p>
