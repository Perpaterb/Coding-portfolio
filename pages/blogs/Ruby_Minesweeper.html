                    <p><b>Time: 16-12-20 </b> First  assignment with Ruby</p>
                    <p> This was the first full app in Ruby<br>
                    The assignment was to create a full ruby terminal app. <br>
                    We needed to use at least 2 Ruby Gems<br>
                    We needed to do proper rspec testing<br>
                    We needed to make it execute with a bash file. (I added some starting checks from ruby and gems to my batch file as well)<br>
                    <br>
                    https://github.com/Perpaterb/minesweeper<br>
                    <br>
                    The git hub has the flow graph and project management stuff.<br>    
                    <br>
                    We also need to give a presentation in front of the class thats in 2 days (18-12-2020)<br>
                    <br>
                    I am quite comfortable with ruby and have been doing a bit of codewars puzzles on the side<br>
                    <br>
                    I have been finished for a few days including documentation and slides<br>
                    Makes me think i should have done something harder<br>
                    <br>
                    </p>
